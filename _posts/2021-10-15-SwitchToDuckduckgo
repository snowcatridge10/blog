# Switch from Google to Duckduckgo

Why?

Because Google tracks every single search that is made and keeps it in their database

So that means they have every search from the first search ever on Google?

Yes

And then they sell the searches of to random companies

That means that random companies are seeing my searches?

Yes

Duckduckgo does none of that. Switch to Duckduckgo.
